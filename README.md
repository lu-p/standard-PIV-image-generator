# standard-PIV-image-generator

Matlab based image generator for standard PIV

Each Matlab file in this repositoty uses a different velocity field to generate PIV particle images:
- a second order velocity field
- a Rankine vortex,
- a Rankine vortex with shear effect.

The generation process is the same for all the scripts.
